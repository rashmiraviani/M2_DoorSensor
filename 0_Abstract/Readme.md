ABSTRACT
Door Opener project is a simple project based on door sensor and Atmega328, which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object. 
Door Sensor is connected to bit 1 of Port B,and an leds connected to bit 6 of port C. An AVR C program to monitor the door sensor and when it opens, turns on the LED and when it closes , turns of the LED it is done using embedded c. Door sensor can be used at shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals etc. where, as soon as a person approaches the door, the door automatically slides open and close.
