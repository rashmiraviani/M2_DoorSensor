# Requirements

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to Automaticaly sense the door and turn off light .The project has been developed to carry out a opertion of turning on and off hte light which connected with door automatically .The device feeds us the information about the door status through ATMEGA328 inside circuit and sesnses the door that here acts as a switch whether they are present inside the room using motion detected sensor and turns the device to perform change.



## SWOT ANALYSIS
#### Mode Selection
####  Sensor with LED
#### View
## Auto Turn ON and OFF
### Sense the temperature
#### Normalize
#### User Friendly
   


### 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who
### To People

## What
*   To bulid a automatic system to have the use to experince the automation in our home 

## When
*   When the user wants to change his door or room to lit automatically

## Where
*  This can be applied any where even in the home, office,theater,Kitchen,Hotels etc..,

## How
