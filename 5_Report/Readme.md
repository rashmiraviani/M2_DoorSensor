## Report
   
#### The proposed system consists of Atmega8 microcontroller, LED, push button and Voltage.
#### This system controls the  lights in room using sensor replaced by switch and resistor .

#### The aim of the project is to Automaticaly sense the door and turn off light .The project has been developed to carry out a opertion of turning on and off hte light which connected with door automatically .The device feeds us the information about the door status through ATMEGA328 inside circuit and sesnses the door that here acts as a switch whether they are present inside the room using motion detected sensor and turns the device to perform change.

#### Door Sensor project is a simple project based on door sensor and Atmega328, which automatically opens and closes the door by detecting a person or object. 
#### Door Sensor is connected to bit 1 of Port B,and an leds connected to bit6 of port C. 
#### An AVR C program to monitor the door sensor and when it opens, turns on the LED and when it closes , turns of the LED it is done using embeded c. #### Door sensor can be used at shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals etc. where, as soon as a person approaches the door, the door automatically slides open
#### As the resistance value is maximum in the midnights, real time clock comes into the play. 
#### Then lights are switched on for 2 to 3 minutes and switched off automatically

## All Test Cases are Passed 
## Thus the result of the project is as implemented designed and Executed Effectively
